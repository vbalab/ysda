# Lecture 1 - Intro

Full C++ is supported for the **host** code.  
However, only a subset of C++ is fully supported for the **device** code.

## `nvcc`

`nvcc` (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler) - compiler driver provided by NVIDIA.

It separates:

- Host code (runs on **CPU**): regular C++ code

- Device code (runs on **GPU**): marked by `__global__`, `__device__`, or `__host__ __device__`

Combines the CPU object files and embedded GPU binaries into a final executable.

```bash
nvcc main.cu
nvcc --compiler-bindir=/usr/bin/g++-11 main.cu                          # specifying C++ compiler
nvcc --compiler-bindir=/usr/bin/g++-11 -Xcompiler "-Wall -O2" main.cu   # adding g++ flags

nvidia-smi                                                              # see GPUs
nvidia-smi -L

./a.out                                                                 # calls on 0st GPU by default
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 ./a.out                                          # explicitely call on 3rd GPU
# BUT order from `nvidia-smi -L` is different here, because it reprioritizes by GPU generation
# -> use either:
CUDA_DEVICE_ORDED=PCI_BUS_ID CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 ./a.out
# OR
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU-6c76a2c5-5375-aa06-11d4-0fddfac30e91 ./a.out    # better!
```

## Function Attributes

| Attribute             | Meaning                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `__global__`          | Called from host with `<<<...>>>`, runs on device|
| `__device__`          | Called from device, runs on device|
| `__host__`            | Called from host, runs on host (default in C++) |
| `__host__ __device__` | Can be called from both host and device          |

**CUDA kernel** - (`__global__`) GPU function launched from the CPU and executed in parallel by many threads on the GPU.

> You write the kernel as if it’s for _one_ thread, and CUDA runs it in _many_ threads.

## Variable Attributes

| Attribute      | Location                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `__device__`   | Global memory (GPU, accessible by all threads) |
| `__shared__`   | Shared memory (per block, fast access)         |
| `__constant__` | Constant memory (read-only, fast, small)       |
| `__managed__`  | Unified memory (accessible by CPU and GPU)     |

## CUDA Hierarchy

Grid $\to$ Blocks $\to$ Warps $\to$ Threads.

Both blocks and threads can be _1D, 2D, or 3D_.

```cpp
int32_t x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
```

```cpp
dim3 blockDim{16, 16}; // 256 threads per block
dim3 gridDim{32, 32};  // 1024 blocks per grid -> 262,144 threads

__global__ void KernelFunc();

KernelFunc<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>();
```

### Thread

**Thread** - single execution unit (like a mini CPU core) that runs the **kernel**.

Memory:

- own registers
- local memory
- shared access to memory _within block_
- global memory

### Warp

**Warp** - the real hardware unit - group of _32_ CUDA threads that execute instructions in lock-step on a **Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)**.

All 32 threads in a warp share the same **program counter (PC)** — they execute _the same instruction_ at _the same time_, on _different data_.

### Block

**Block** - array of threads grouped by warps.

Since block made of warps $\to$ do number of threads in block $: 32$.

All threads in a block run _on one_ SM.  
Threads within a block are executed _warp by warp_, not all at once.

`dim_{SM} <= 1024` $\to$ `blockDim <= 1024`

### Grid

**Grid** - array of blocks.

`gridDim < 2 << 31 - 1`*

# Lecture 2.1 - Writing Kernel

Data Parallelism is for GPU

SPMD

Task Parallelism is for CPU

## Sync

CUDA Kernel execution is async $\to$ use `cudaDeviceSynchronize`.

```bash
CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 ./a.out  # all kernel functions are synchronized
```

## Memory Allocation

- CUDA has no RAII

- Host/Device pointers data are indistinguishable $\to$ Write `Host`/`Device` suffixes in code

- There is no lazy memory allocation $\to$ If you did `cudaMalloc`, then it actually allocated physical memory

```cpp
constexpr size_t kElemenents = 1 << 20;
constexpr size_t kBufferSize = kElemenents * sizeof(int);

int* aHost = reinterpret_cast<int*>(malloc(kBufferSize));
int* bHost = reinterpret_cast<int*>(malloc(kBufferSize));

int* aDevice;
CudaCheck(cudaMalloc(&aDevice, kBufferSize));

cudaMemcpy(aDevice, aHost, kBufferSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
cudaMemcpy(bHost, aDevice, kBufferSize, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

cudaFree(aDevice);
free(bHost);
free(aHost);
```

## `cudaError`

CUDA returns flags like any syscall.

```cpp
void CudaCheck(cudaError_t cuda_error) {
  if (cuda_error == cudaSuccess) {
    return;
  }

  throw std::runtime_error(cudaGetErrorString(cuda_error));
}
```

## `compute-sanitizer`

```bash
/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin/compute-sanitizer ./a.out
/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin/compute-sanitizer --leak-check=full ./a.out
```

# Lecture 2.2 - GPU Architectures

## PTX, SASS

CUDA C++ $\to$ PTX (virtual ISA) $\to$ SASS (real ISA) $\to$ GPU

**PTX (Parallel Thread Execution)** - **JIT-compiled** or **AOT-emitted** intermediate (like LLVM IR), virtual assembly language, portable across GPU generations.

**SASS (Streaming Assembler)** - hardware-specific low-level machine code executed on specific GPU architecture by SMs.

Why JIT is used on GPUs?

- Only way for applications to run on devices that did not exist at the time the application was compiled

- Portability across GPU generations

- Runtime-known constants (e.g., tensor shapes)

> If you provide nothing or only provide PTX and observe a noticeable startup delay the first time the kernel is launched — that’s the JIT compiler working $\to$ use `nsys` and `nvprof`.

### Flags

| nvcc flag             | Output        | PTX-to-SASS compiled at                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--ptx`               | `.ptx` file   | **At runtime (JIT)**                                    |
| `--cubin`             | `.cubin` file | Already SASS — done at **compile-time**                 |
| `--fatbin` or default | `.fatbin`     | Contains both PTX and SASS; **driver chooses at runtime** |

Specifying GPU:

```bash
# compute_XX - PTX code target
# sm_XX - SASS code target
-gencode=arch=compute_XX,sm_XX
```

```bash
CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT=1        # no SASS lookup
CUDA_DISABLE_PTX_JIT=1      # no PTX lookup
```

To see how it gets compiled:

```bash
nvcc main.cu -time stat
less -S stat
```

# Lecture 3 - Blocks

## CPU vs GPU

![alt text](notes_images/cpuvsgpu1.png)

![alt text](notes_images/cpuvsgpu2.png)

> The GPU devotes more transistors to data processing but lucks functionality

## Synchronization

All threads _within block_ should reach _the same_ `__syncthreads()`, otherwise deadlock.

`__syncthreads()` acts on shared memory $\to$ is expected to be lightweight.

There is no synchronization between blocks.

## Indexing

```cpp
constexpr size_t kElemenents = 1 << 12;
constexpr size_t kBufferSize = kElemenents * sizeof(int);

constexpr size_t kThreads = 1024;
constexpr dim3 kBlockDim{kThreads};
constexpr dim3 kGridDim{(kElemenents + kThreads - 1) / kThreads};
```

```cpp
int linearThreadIdx = threadIdx.x * 1
                    + threadIdx.y * blockDim.x
                    + threadIdx.z * blockDim.y * blockDim.x;

int warpIdx = linearThreadIdx / 32;
int laneIdx = linearThreadIdx % 32;
```

## Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)

> Modern SMs are often split internally into multiple partitions (**sub-SMs**).

- **SM**: has L1 data cache, shared memory, texture units, instruction cache _that sub-SMs can use_.

- **sub-SM**: has its own L0 instruction cache, warp scheduler, register file, execution pipelines.

![GPU of SMs](notes_images/gpu_sms.png)

![One SM](notes_images/gpu_sm.png)

Not all data types get dedicated hardware.  
Other precisions (e.g. INT8, INT16, FP16, BF16, TF32) are executed on these _existing_ units.

## Warp Scheduling

**Zero overhead** for **warp-switching** (while switching context on CPU is heavy).

## Control Divergence

**Control divergence** - happens when threads in the same warp follow different execution paths due to conditional branches (`if`, `switch`, `for`, etc.).

Divergence _reduces_ parallel efficiency, since only part of the warp is active at a time.

![alt text](notes_images/control_divergence.png)

### Independent Thread Scheduling

Starting with Volta (Compute Capability 7.0), NVIDIA introduced **Independent Thread Scheduling**:  
Each thread has _its own_ PC, call stack, and register state $\to$ divergent threads can progress without waiting for others.

BUT: Requires **explicit synchronization** in some cases where programmers previously assumed implicit warp lockstep.  
CUDA introduced `__syncwarp()` for this.

![alt text](notes_images/independent_thread_scheduling.png)

# Lecture 4 - Shared Memory

```bash
nvidia-smi dmon -i 1  # to see pwr, temp, mem, ...
```

## FLOP

**FLOP** - single floating-point operation (e.g., `a + b`, `x * y`).

**FLOPS** - FLOPs per second (a performance metric).

| GPU               | FP32 (TFLOPS) | FP64 (TFLOPS) |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| NVIDIA RTX 3090   | 35.6          | 0.56          |
| NVIDIA A100       | 19.5          | 9.7           |
| NVIDIA H100       | 67            | 34            |

Compilers often optimize `a * b + c` into a single **FMA** instruction (counts as 2 FLOPs).

**Arithmetic Intensity** = FLOP / B - FLOP per byte of memory transferred.  
It helps analyze whether a kernel is **compute-bound** or **memory-bound**.

| Kernel          | FLOP/B          | Bound    |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Matrix Multiply | $ \frac{N}{6} $ | Compute  |
| Vector Add      | 0.08            | Memory   |
| 3D Stencil      | 1–2             | Memory   |
| FFT             | ~5              | Balanced |

### Example

```cpp
__global__ void MatMul(float *A, float *B, float *C, size_t N, size_t M, size_t K) {
    size_t row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    size_t col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row >= M || col >= N) {
      return;
    }
  
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (size_t k = 0; k < K; ++k) {
        sum += A[row * K + k] * B[k * N + col];  // 2 FLOPs (multiply + add)
    }

    C[row * N + col] = sum;
}

// Total FLOPs: (M * N) * K * 2
```

> 1:24:00

The problem is, while having a lot more of compute, we have ~cache memory as in CPU.

## Memory Types

| Memory Type     | Scope       | Location             | Performance                 | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Registers**   | Per-thread  | On-chip              | Fastest                     | Used automatically for scalar vars.                |
| **Local Memory**| Per-thread  | Off-chip (DRAM)      | Slow (≈ global memory)      | Despite the name, stored in DRAM; used when registers spill or for arrays. |
| **Shared Memory**| Per-block  | On-chip (lives on L1) | Much faster than DRAM       | _Programmer-managed cache_; enables intra-block communication.           |
| **Global Memory**| Per-grid   | Device DRAM          | Slowest (unless coalesced)  | Accessible to all threads and the host. |
| **Constant Memory**| Per-grid | Device DRAM + cache  | Fast if broadcasted         | Read-only for device; cached. |

Both shared memory and L1 cache are implemented in the same on-chip **SRAM**, partitioned between them.
